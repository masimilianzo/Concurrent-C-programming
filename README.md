# Concurrent-C-programming
Some of my OS course excercises

# ex1
In this program, 3 processes pass each other a C value via FIFOs.
C is the average between A and B, each process has each own value of A and B (expect at the beginning, A is 20 for all processes).
If C gets bigger than 27, the program ends.
